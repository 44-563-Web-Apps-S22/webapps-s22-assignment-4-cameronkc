      MUSIC MASTER: (To Musicians) Come, come into this room, sit there and wait
      until he comes. DANCING MASTER: (To dancers) And you too, on this side.
      MUSIC MASTER: (To Pupil) Is it done? PUPIL: Yes. MUSIC MASTER: Let's
      see... This is good. DANCING MASTER: Is it something new? MUSIC MASTER:
      Yes, it's a melody for a serenade that I set him to composing here, while
      waiting for our man to awake. DANCING MASTER: May I see it? MUSIC MASTER:
      You'll hear it, with the dialogue, when he comes. He won't be long.
