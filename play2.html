      <span class="cleonte">CLEONTE:</span> Ambousahim oqui boraf, Iordina,
      salamalequi. <span class="covielle">COVIELLE:</span>That is to say:
      "Monsieur Jourdain, may your heart be all the year like a flowering
      rosebush." This is the way of speaking politely in those countries.
      </span> I am the most humble servant of His Turkish Highness.
      <span class="covielle">COVIELLE:</span> Carigar camboto oustin moraf.
      <span class="cleonte">CLEONTE:</span> Oustin yoc catamalequi basum base
      alla moran. <span class="covielle">COVIELLE:</span> He says: "Heaven gives
      you the strength of lions and the wisdom of serpents."

      Highness honors me too much, and I wish him all sorts of good fortune.

      <span class="covielle">COVIELLE:</span> He says that you should go with
      him quickly to prepare yourself for the ceremony; then you can see your
      daughter and conclude the marriage. </span> So many things in
      two words? <span class="covielle">COVIELLE:</span> Yes; the Turkish
      language is like that, it says much in few words. Go quickly where he
      wants.
